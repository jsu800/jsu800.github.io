<h2>Joseph</h2>

<p>

As a Principal Software Architect with over 18 years of experience, I have developed many enterprise software applications with millions of users across web, mobile, wearable, and connected devices. I have worked on highly scalable & extensible REST webservices & architectures for Fortune 100 sites drawing billions of page views.

<br>
<br>

I have extensive technical management experience, from shepherding open-source technologies to supporting executive-level strategic planning at the world's largest media conglomerates including Disney, Comcast, and NBCUniversal.

<br>
<br>

I love applying technology to solve problems at scale, taking ideas from inception to launch: working & maintainable software. I regularly impart my experience to others by example and through teaching.
