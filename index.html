<p>
As a Principal Software Architect with over 18 years of experience, I have developed many enterprise software applications with 
millions of users across web, mobile, wearable, and connected devices. I have worked on highly scalable & extensible 
REST webservices & architectures for Fortune 100 sites drawing billions of page views.
</p>

<p>
I have extensive technical management experience, from shepherding open-source technologies to supporting executive-level 
strategic planning at the world's largest media conglomerates including Disney, Comcast, and NBCUniversal.
</p>

<p>
I love applying technology to solve problems at scale, taking ideas from inception to launch: working & maintainable software. 
I regularly impart my experience to others by example and through mentoring, coaching, and teaching.

<p>In my free time once in a blue moon, I indulge in the creation of arts 
drawing inspirations from <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/">M. C. Escher</a> 
and the likes. I love surrealism and mathematically-inspired woodcuts, 
lithographs, and mezzotints.</p>

<p>This piece won me the 2nd place in New York State art competition in 1993:</p>

<p>This piece was on exhibit in New York Metropolitan Museum of Art circa 1994:</p>
<p><img width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/human evolution.png" border=10></p>

<p>My doodling also revolves around science-inspired subjects. "Compression": </p>
<p><img  width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/compression.png" border=10></p>

<p>Or "Collision": </p>
<p><img  width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/collision.png" border=10></p>

<p>This piece was published on the inset of the <i>Journal of American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA, Vol 277, No. 13, April 2, 1997</i>):</p>

<p>I have many more arts in my trouve - just need to find time to digitally scan them in to post here. Stay tuned!</p>
