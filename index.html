<p>
As a Principal Software Architect with over 18 years of experience, I have developed many enterprise software applications with 
millions of users across web, mobile, wearable, and connected devices. I have worked on highly scalable & extensible 
REST webservices & architectures for Fortune 100 sites drawing billions of page views.
</p>

<p>
I have extensive technical management experience, from shepherding open-source technologies to supporting executive-level 
strategic planning at the world's largest media conglomerates including Disney, Comcast, and NBCUniversal.
</p>

<p>
I love applying technology to solve problems at scale, taking ideas from inception to launch: working & maintainable software. 
I regularly impart my experience to others by example and through mentoring, coaching, and teaching.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Publications</h3>

<p>I love math but knew a long time ago that I would never be good enough to make a living of it. I dabbled into the world of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">Number Theory</a> for a year in High School, took several semesters of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra">Abstract Algebra</a> and advanced mathematic topics in college and 
graduate school. I submitted and published a few solution-articles in the <i>College Mathematics Journal</i> 
in college. It was fun time.

<p>In 2007, I published a number theory paper in <i>Journal of Integer Sequences</i>:</p>

* J. Su. "On Some Properties of Two Simultaneous Polygonal Sequences". <i>Journal of Integer Sequences</i>; Vol. 10,
Issue 10, Article 07.10.4, 2007. Web version: <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL10/Su/su.pdf">http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL10/Su/su.pdf</a>

<p>In my free time once in a blue moon, I indulge in the creation of arts 
drawing inspirations from <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/">M. C. Escher</a> 
and the likes. I love surrealism and mathematically-inspired woodcuts, 
lithographs, and mezzotints.</p>

<p>This piece won me the 2nd place in New York State art competition in 1993:</p>
<p><img  width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/self portrait.png" border=10></p>

<p>This piece was on exhibit in New York Metropolitan Museum of Art circa 1994:</p>
<p><img width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/human evolution.png" border=10></p>

<p>My doodling also revolves around science-inspired subjects. "Compression": </p>
<p><img  width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/compression.png" border=10></p>

<p>Or "Collision": </p>
<p><img  width=“50%" height=“50%" src="/images/collision.png" border=10></p>

<p>This piece was published on the inset of the <i>Journal of American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA, Vol 277, No. 13, April 2, 1997</i>):</p>
<p><img  width=“100%" height=“100%" src="/images/medical illustration.png" border=10></p>
<p><img  width=“100%" height=“100%" src="/images/medical illustration 2.png" border=10></p>

<p>I have many more arts in my trouve - just need to find time to digitally scan them in to post here. Stay tuned!</p>
