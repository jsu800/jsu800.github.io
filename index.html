<h2>About Joseph</h2>

<p>

As a Principal Software Architect with over 18 years of experience, I have developed many enterprise software applications with 
millions of users across web, mobile, wearable, and connected devices. I have worked on highly scalable & extensible REST webservices 
& architectures for Fortune 100 sites drawing billions of page views.

<br>
<br>

I have extensive technical management experience, from shepherding open-source technologies to supporting executive-level 
strategic planning at the world's largest media conglomerates including Disney, Comcast, and NBCUniversal.

<br>
<br>

I love applying technology to solve problems at scale, taking ideas from inception to launch: working & maintainable software. 
I regularly impart my experience to others by example and through teaching.

<h3>Art Portfolio: "Prior Arts" </h3>

In my free time once in a blue moon, I indulge in the creation of arts 
drawing inspirations from <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/">M. C. Escher</a> 
and the likes. I love surrealism and study mathematically-inspired woodcuts, 
lithographs, and mezzotints.
